## Use this style for your own portfolio

If you like this portfolio, you may fork it and modify it to make it your own. I've made certain design choices that should make it easier for you to use.

## Reusable components

Look for the project-list.json in src/components/Projects/ folder. Replace my projects with information about your own and they will appear in their own cards on the Projects page. Replace profilePic.jpg in src/Images with your own and it will show on the Home page. Replace the resume pdf in the same folder and rename the link reference in src/components/resume.jsx so your resume will appear with the zoom slider. To change the typewriter text on the home page go to src/components/home/home.jsx and change the properties passed into the Typewriter component. The Typerwriter component accepts any length array of strings.

Modify modules in src/components if you want to keep the look and feel of the application the same. 

## Getting started

Clone this repository, and run `npm install && npm start` or `yarn add && yarn start`. The default browser will open a newpage at localhost:3000.

If you host this outside of GitHub pages replace the imported HashRouter component to ReactRouter in App.js to remove the `#` in the address bar while navigating through pages.
