## Use this style for your own portfolio

If you like this portfolio, you may fork it and modify it to make it your own. I've made certain design choices that should make it easier for you to use.

For example: Look for the project-list.json in src/components/Projects/ folder. Replace my projects with information about your own and they will appear in their own cards on the Projects page. Replace profilePic.jpg in src/Images with your own and it will show on the Home page. Replace the resume pdf in the same folder and rename the link reference in src/components/resume.js so your resume will appear with the zoom slider.

## Getting started

Clone this repository, and run `npm install && npm start` or `yarn add && yarn start`. The default browser will open a newpage at localhost:3000.
