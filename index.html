                        I am a Cybersecurity student at Kennesaw State University. I'm currently working as an Information Security 
                        and Compliance Analyst as well as provide Tier 2 level IT Support at Inspired Technologies in Tallhassee, Fl. 
                        I donate time outside of work at Greenwood in Valdosta, Ga acting as the volunteer IT Administrator, lead 
                        sound engineer, and live broadcast coordinator. I don't have enough bookshelves for all the books I've read 
                        and would like to read.

                        I'm a detail oriented web developer with experience in Javascript, CSS, AWS, Azure, Powershell, and C#.
                        Looking for an opportunity to work in a challenging position to combine my skills in Web Development, that 
                        provides opportinity for professional development, interesting experiences, and new relationship building.

                        ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can't tell 
                        good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized 
                        that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same 
                        mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate 
                        me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together 
                        like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is 
                        unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural.”
